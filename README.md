# Handmade Studio Online Store

- In this project I used the Commercejs API to build an ecommerce store. Users are able to navigate through the pages and view the seperate products available able to view the videos, product description, and pricing. Funcitonality also includes adding products to a cart, editing the quantity of the item in the cart, removing the item from the cart, and viewing the cart total creating a online shopping experience.

- Navigating on the website can be done using the navigation bar where the categories are presented for you to view. 
- You are able to click into the individual categories they are interested in and can view the information of the products that correspond with the category selected.
- You can click into the product that you are interested in and view additional details, the price, along with an image of the item.
- Once you click into an item you can also view related products with the product's name, price, and image that you can navigate to and view the related produt's details.
- While on a specific product's page you are able to select a quanity desired and click on the add to bag button.
- Once you click on the button and select a quantity the quantity will update on the upper right cart icon.
- You are then able to navigate to your cart clicking on the icon on the upper right corner of a cart and view the products you have added and if you have not added any items to your cart yet you will be prompted with a message stating that your cart is empty.
